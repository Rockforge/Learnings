* Blockchain
  - single source of truth when it comes ot transactions
* Metamask
** Has test networks that you can use
** Steps of transaction in metamask
   1. Talks to Infura
   2. Infura talks to the blockchain node
   3. Blockchain node talks to the blockain
   4. and goes back up
* Ethereum Transactions
** Parts of a Ethereum Transaction
   - from: [account]
   - to: [account] (optional)
   - value: [integer] in wei
   - gas: maximum amount of gas used
   - gasPrice: amount of wei per gas
   - data: ABI Byte string (optional)
   - nonce: Integer of a nonce
** How does it know it's allowed to transfer amount
   - It uses a *signature*
   - *signTransaction* function in web3js
     - The account needs to be unlocked
** Accounts and Signing
   1. A private key is used by Metamask
   2. The private key is then processed using
      ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm)
   3. The output of that is then used as the public key (64 bytes long)
   4. The public key is then used to create an ethereum account
   5. The private key is also used to create a signed transaction
   6. The signed transaction is then ran through a ECRECOVER function then
      compares that to a Ethereum account to validate the transaction
** Key Take-aways
   - Transaction signatures ensure authenticity of transactions
   - Signatures are generated from private keys
   - Public keys and addresses are generated from private keys
   - Private keys have to be kept save under all circumstances
* Cryptographic Hashing
  - hash function :: a function that takes input and outputs a digest
** Five ideal properties
   - it is detertiministic so the same message always results in the same hash
   - it is quick to compute the hash value for any given message
   - it is infeasible to generate a message from its hash value except
     by trying all possible messages
   - a small change in the message should change the hash value so extensively
     that the new hash value appears uncorrelated with the old hash value
   - it is infeasible to find two different messages with the same hash value
** Key take-aways
   - Hashing is the mathematical foundation of blockchains
   - Blocks have hashes of previous blocks
     - Are chained together
   - Changing information in a previous block changes all the blocks thereafter (infeasible)
