* Decorator Pattern
  - Wrapping classes to add some functionality
  - Doesn't relly on inheritance

* Adapter Pattern
  - An adapter allows you to translate one interface for use with another

* Template Method Pattern
  - We extract methods that are reused into an abstract class
    and differences are deferred into a subclass
  - When there's just enough differences but you don't really know how to do that
